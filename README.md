Updated Refactor Code,

We update the code that you sent to us to make it more accessible and stuctured the html as well as the css. In the html we changed many of the tags that are used to updated ones that give us more of an idea of where they are located such as the header and footer tags as well and adjusted some of the links. For the css paged we consoladated many of the styles to fit in specific groups such as the ones for images on the benefits and job page as well as the h2, h3. We did make a big change by consolidating all the styles for SEO, online reputation management, and social media marketing into one tag called area.

Had to screenshot the webpage because it would fit on the READme.
